Description:
The Task Management App is a user-friendly web application that helps users and specially Sunita Sharma keep track of their Tasks and ensures timely Task intake. With an intuitive user interface, the app allows users to add new Tasks, specify dosages, and set reminders for different frequencies (daily, weekly, or monthly). Users can mark Tasks as "taken"  and view upcoming Tasks for the next day.

Features:

    Add and manage Tasks with names, dosages, and frequencies.
    Set reminders for daily, weekly, or monthly Task intakes.
    User can Mark Tasks as "taken" for present day and user won't be allowed to mark upcoming Tasks for next day.
    View a list of Tasks scheduled for the current and next day.
    Automatic date tracking to provide relevant reminders.

Technologies Used:

    Frontend: React.js for building the user interface.
    State Management: useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and side effects.
    Local Storage: To store Task data locally for persisting information across sessions.
    CSS: Custom-styled components for a visually appealing and responsive design.

    Install the project dependencies using npm install.
    Start the development server using npm start.
    Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
    Add new Tasks and set their properties.
    And now you are good to go !
